Frontend Mentor Testimonials Challenge


This is a solution for the Frontend Mentor testimonials page challenge. I haven't used grid layouts very much but I feel confident with them after creating this design. I was able to create two different grid layouts for different viewport sizes, along with using flexbox for mobile. 

I had some trouble getting the main section to center in the viewport. I ended up finding some unneeded code that was limiting the height of the body and causing the card container to overflow, so the margin wasn't showing. 

I would appreciate any general feedback, or tips on how to improve accessiblitty and responsiveness.
